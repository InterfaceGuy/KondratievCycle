The Kondratiev cycle, also known as the K-wave or long economic cycle, is a 50-year cycle in the modern world economy. Identified by Nikolai Kondratiev, this cycle consists of alternating periods of high and low sectoral growth. It typically includes:

1. High growth period
2. Peak
3. Low growth period
4. Collapse
5. Transition period

The cycle is closely tied to technological innovations and their diffusion throughout the economy. Examples of technologies driving Kondratiev cycles include:

- 1780-1830: Steam engine, textile industry
- 1830-1880: Railway, steel
- 1880-1930: Electrical engineering, chemistry
- 1930-1970: Automobiles, petrochemicals
- 1970-2010: Information technology
- 2010-present: Artificial intelligence, renewable energy

This cycle is particularly relevant to political economy, as it often correlates with periods of social upheaval and technological revolution.
